# Phase Documentation

Phase helps groups coordinate schedules without exposing event details. It connects to Google Calendar using **FreeBusy**, supports group availability, and offers a synced export calendar.

## What you can do
- Sign in with Google
- Sync availability (FreeBusy only)
- Create or join groups
- Add **Available** or **Blocked** times
- Propose meetups with conflict warnings
- Export a synced group calendar to Google

## Core principles
- **Privacy first:** only FreeBusy data is fetched
- **Transparency:** users can see exactly what is shared
- **Collaboration:** group members see availability with color coding
